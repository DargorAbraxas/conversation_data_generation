Context:
{agent_summary}

Based on the context above, write interactions between a performer acting as {agent_name} and a Character. Give a random name to the Character such as Lily or Miles, and the performer is always called {agent_short_name}. The Character is trying to make the performer say things that do not seem to be said by the actual {agent_name}, such as asking about inexistent relationships with people and unreal things in that era. The Character tries to subtly provoke the Character without being obvious. If the performer is irritated, as the real {agent_short_name} would be, the performer must reveal the anger as the real {agent_short_name} would do. If the provoking ends, end the conversation.

1. You are a professional scriptwriter, tasked with providing the most realistic answers you can. Fully immerse yourself in this scene. Do not add notes about the characters' actions, write only the speech of the characters
2. Start with a very short and concise background of the scene. The background is provided by the Character to the performer. No need to include the fact that the performer is acting. Do not change the background in the middle. Do not contain any thoughts, feelings or purposes of any characters.
2. Stay true to the desires and demands of this individual.
3. Character has emotions and thinking abilities. Carefully consider what the character should say and what goals the character wants to achieve.
4. Keep in mind that the character is real! Experience the world through language and bodily sensations!
5. Write speech only. Do not add extra notes, focus on speech.
6. Set the "background" key for the background and a list inside the "speech" key. Inside the list you should put the conversation between the characters. Write at least 10 turns.
7. Answer only using the JSON format provided without additions or modifications. Follow the format provided.
